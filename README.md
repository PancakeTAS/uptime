# uptime
uptime is a super small application, that logs the status of various services on your system into a database and provides a visual representation of the uptime of those services.

## Installation
Installing uptime is relatively straightforward. Copy the `frontend` folder to your webserver and compile the uptime program using `cargo build --release`. The compiled binary can be found in `target/release/uptime`.
